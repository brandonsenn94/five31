# five31
Generates a monthly cycle of the 531 program.

I have some features that are planned.
1) I want to add a feature into the program to export to CSV file. (/) Done.
2) I wanted to include some of that into the main program, but unfortunately I couldn't figure it out.
   Once I get more experience, I'm thinking I want to add a GUI to the program itself so it's not just some console program. 
   However, I'm not at that level of skill just yet. I'll get started on GUI when hopefully I'm a little bit more experienced. 
4) Maybe down the road, I could create an app for android once I figure out event-based programming. Will take a look at the android docs later down the road.
